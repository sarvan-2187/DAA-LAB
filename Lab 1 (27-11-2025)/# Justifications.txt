Justifications:

1. Sum of 'n' natural numbers -> Formula based approach (n(n+1)/2) so it takes O(1) Space Complexity

2. Sum of squares of 'n' natural numbers -> Formula based approach ((n(n+1)(2n+1))/6) so it takes O(1) Space Complexity

3. Sum of cubes of 'n' natural numbers -> Formula based approach (n(n+1)/2)^2 so it takes O(1) Space Complexity

4. Factorial using Recursion Program -> Used recursion and as the function is recursively called n times it takes O(N) Space Complexity

5. Transpose of 3x3 matrix -> Tweaked the code while taking input itself and also used the fixed size array it takes O(1) Space Complexity

6. FIbonacci Series -> Used recursion based approach for this with a repeated for loop call so it takes O(N) Space Complexity
